== Check for errors ==
 * update version number in src/base/utils/miximkerneldefs.h
 * new clean checkout of MiXiM
 * make sure "makemakefiles" is up to date
 * make sure CHANGELOG is up to date 
 * for debug and release config and from IDE and command line and for each OS do the following:
   * compile
   * run tests (floating point precision caused diffs and execution time diffs are ok)
     * mixim and
     * mixnet
   * test examples
     * mixim and
     * mixnet
   
== Package MiXiM and upload ==
The following steps can be done in parallel to the "check for errors" above, but
if the check for errors unearth a problem you have to fix, all off the following
steps will have to be done again.

 * create a clean archive of the revision to release by 
 	"git archive <branch> -o MiXiM-x.x.tar.gz"
 * open a new Omnet++ IDE with a clean workspace
 * import latest inet4mixnet
 * import mixim and mixnet from the just created archive
 * DO NOT build the projects!
 * make neddoc (see below)
 * copy doc folder from Mixnet project to the MiXiM projects "inet/" path
 * create archive of the MiXiM project including the generated docs and
   excluding "doc/release-steps", ".gitignore" and "PAX-something"
 * add new release to mixims source forge site 
   ("http://apps.sourceforge.net/trac/sourceforge/wiki/Release%20files%20for%20download")
 * upload CHANGELOG to sourceforge and set it as the releases release notes
 * update What changed site on Mixim wiki
 * update download link at http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/mixim/wiki/StepByStep
 
   
== DoxyGen and NedDoc ==
 * make sure the VERSION tag init MiXiM's "doc/doxy.cfg" is up to date
 * use the omnet IDE to create the ned doc for MiXiM, inet and Mixnet
 * export doc folders of all three projects into the same archive
 * upload new doc to sourceforge
   * read "http://apps.sourceforge.net/trac/sourceforge/wiki/Shell%20service" 
     on how to get a shell for mixim on sourceforge
   * extract/copy compiled neddoc to "/home/groups/m/mi/mixim/htdocs/doc-x.x/"
   * update symbolic link "/home/project-web/mixim/htdocs/doc/" to the new doc
     path "/home/project-web/mixim/htdocs/doc-x.x/"
