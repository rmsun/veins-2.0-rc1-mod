This file contains the general installation hints to compile and start using
MiXiM.


Requirements
============
- OMNeT++, at least version 4.1, 
  downloadable at www.omnetpp.org
  OMNeT++ must be compiled with 
  	- dynamic NED loading (WITH_NETBUILDER=yes setting)
  	- and XML support enabled 
- make (for Linux)
- C++ compiler (for Linux)
- at least Mac OS X 10.5 (for Mac users)


Installation 
============

From the Omnet++ IDE
--------------------
The MiXiM archive contains two projects: MiXiM and Mixnet. 
Mixnet is only important if you want to use MiXiM together with the INET
framework. If you already know that you'll need Mixnet you can import it
together with MiXiM during the following steps. If you are not sure just ignore
it, you can always install it later separately. For more details on Mixnet take
a look at its README file in MiXiM's "inet" folder.

The following steps should be the same for every operating system.

1. Choose "File->Import" from the menu.

2. Choose "General->Existing Projects into Workspace" from the upcoming dialog 
and proceed with "Next".

3. Choose "Select archive file" and select the MiXiM archive file.

4. "MiXiM" and "Mixnet" should appear in the "Projects" list below. Remove the
check before "Mixnet" if you are not sure whether you need it. You can always
install it later separately. 
At last click "Finish". 

5. To build MiXiM right-click on the project and choose "Build Project".

6. Run an example:
	1. Choose an example from the examples directory.
	2. Right click its executeable and choose 
		"Run as" -> "Run configurations...".
	3. Double click on "Omnet++ Simulation" in the left list to create a new
	   Omnet++ run configuration for this example (each example needs its own
	   Run configuration). The "Working directory" should be the examples
	   directory.
	   Also make sure the correct executable is choosen under 
	   	"Executable: ... Other:" 
	   (should be the one inside the examples directory).
	4. Click "Run"
	
7. To see how to get started with MiXiM please read the section "How to start"
   in the README-file.

From the commandline under Linux
--------------------------------
Unpack the archive (you have probably already done so)
 tar xzf mixim<VERSION>.tgz

1. run the following command in the MiXiM root dir
    make -f makemakefiles CONFIGNAME=gcc-debug
   (you can alternatively also use the gcc-release configuration)

2. type "make all" to make the mixim library and binary 
   and to build the test networks
   
3. Try to run one of the examples from the examples folder.

4. To see how to get started with MiXiM please read the section "How to start"
   in the README-file.
